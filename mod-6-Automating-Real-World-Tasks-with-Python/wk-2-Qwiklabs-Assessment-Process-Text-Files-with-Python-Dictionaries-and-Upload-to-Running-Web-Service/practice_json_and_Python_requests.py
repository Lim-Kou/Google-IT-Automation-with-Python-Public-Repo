# In json,
# objects are key-value pair structures like Python dictionaries,
# arrays, are like Python lists.
# JSON elements are always comma-delimited
# The json library will help us turn Python objects into JSON, and turn JSON strings into Python objects.
# JSON elements can only represent simple data types:
# dict, list, tuple, str, int, float, int- & float-derived Enums, True, False, None
